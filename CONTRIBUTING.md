# Contributing to TwitLess

## Git Workflow

Prior to being merged with `main`, all PRs and checked out branches must merge with `develop`. The `develop` branch will then merge with `main` for any and all updates that add several features or functionality.

Should you choose to work on a feature, check out to a branch for that feature. Branch name should follow the following template: `issue#/brief-description`. For example, for the branch setting up this repository, it was labeled `1/reposetup`.

## Pull Requests

Please make all changes on a forked version of this repository and make PRs from that forked repository _while maintaining the branch naming scheme._ Always ask to merge with `develop`. When making a PR, please list all functionality that should be tested by an administrator of the repository and provide screenshots (of code, tests, front-end appearances, etc). See [this PR](link_tbd) for an example.

The [TwitLess Trello board](https://trello.com/b/KmTS2j0a) details will be announced as soon as I figure out the best way to do that...
