# Prototype

The only thing available in this folder is an exported version of the prototype. The UI Kits and XD Files are git ignored purposefully.

## I want to edit them!

If you want to edit the XD prototype files, please reach out to me on Twitter @Mobkinz78 or on Instagram @markbacon78. That way we can manage users editing the prototype files. Coediting is pretty useful on Adobe XD and we can allow people to edit with me just adding your account via email and Adobe CC.

## Don't know how to prototype?

If you don't know how to use XD but want to mock up a page anyway, feel free to draw out a wireframe in anything, from draw.io to Photoshop! If/when accepted, we can go ahead and make a new task. Then, I'll go ahead and add it to the prototype on XD and re-upload the export with the new feature.
