# TwitLess

_CI badge here. Tests TBD._

Repository for the TwitLess web/mobile app written in React JS.

# Information

TwitLess is an app created with highlighting the most interactive parts of twitter while removing the aspect of infinite scrolling. Twitter is a great platform for outreach because it allows users to easily get in contact with mutual follows and publicly interact. Since the platform is so large, competiting with it is practically impossible. Thus, TwitLess aims to take those interact parts of Twitter (DMs, mentions) and isolate them within an app that removes the current feed.
