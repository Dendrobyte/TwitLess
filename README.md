# TwitLess

_CI badge here. Tests TBD._

Repository for the TwitLess web/mobile app written in React JS.

# Information

TwitLess is an app created with highlighting the most interactive parts of twitter while removing the aspect of infinite scrolling. Twitter is a great platform for outreach because it allows users to easily get in contact with mutual follows and publicly interact. Since the platform is so large, competiting with it is practically impossible. Thus, TwitLess aims to take those interact parts of Twitter (DMs, mentions) and isolate them within an app that removes the current feed.

# Features

This is a list of features for TwitLess and also serves as a sort of "road map" for the progress that will be made. Currently it'll just be the base features.

## MVP

Pretty much based solely on wireframes and/or the prototype.

- [ ] Logging in with OAuth and Twitter
- [ ] Access to your Twitter DMs
- [ ] Access only to tweets you are mentioned in and the tweet they DIRECTLY reply to on an active threads page
  - Will not show long threads or anything
- [ ] Show trending categories and upon clicking you'll be given the top 5 relevant articles from sites such as NYTimes, CNN, etc.
- [ ] Basic setup for a settings page
