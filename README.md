Repository for the TwitLess web/mobile app written with Angular (2022) and the back-end will be using the Laravel PHP framework. You can find all the source and how to run the app locally in the [angular-twitless](/angular-twitless) directory. Please see [the contributing guide](/CONTRIBUTING.md) if you'd like to contribute to the project.

# Information

TwitLess is an app created with highlighting the most interactive parts of twitter while removing the aspect of infinite scrolling. Twitter is a great platform for outreach because it allows users to easily get in contact with mutual follows and publicly interact. Since the platform is so large, competiting with it is practically impossible. Thus, TwitLess aims to take those interactive parts of Twitter (DMs, mentions) and isolate them within an app that removes the current feed.

**Prototype v1:** https://xd.adobe.com/view/1ad41fe9-a80f-4bf5-abe2-2e82dd35fd6f-4f87/ Very limited prototype but I hope it gets across the functionality and navigation of the site. The design itself has many issues but it's a solid starting point. **BEING REDONE**
